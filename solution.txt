Problem: The solution is meant to solve the issue of electronic waste and reduce the heap of idle electronic products in our homes

Solution: E waste has always been a growing problem in the world. The inclusion of circular economy techniques in our day to day life can bring about a huge change in this context. The consumer electronic goods that remains idle in our homes or is inoperative can be thought of as a means to implement the idea. If there exists a system which can collect the inoperative home consumer goods, extract the different parts like transistors, diodes, etc and make it to use in future products, I think it may reduce the problem of e waste marginally. Even if the parts are damaged, in some cases, trying to repair them can be much more cheap way than building a new component altogether. Thus even the manufacturing cost can be reduced. Also, there can be a quick supply of electronic components in the market. 
There can also be a responsible framework of second hand consumer electronic goods. Thus even the poor people can afford the best of consumer electronics without spending much from their pocket. This will include more people in the consumer electronics market which can in turn improve the market forces.
